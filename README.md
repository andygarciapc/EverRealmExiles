# EverRealm Exiles

EverRealm Exiles is a medieval fantasy **extraction RPG** where players venture into dangerous, procedurally driven realms to loot, survive, and escape — or lose everything trying.

Built in Unity, the game blends tactical combat, high-risk exploration, and persistent progression in a dark fantasy setting.

---

## 🎮 Game Concept

Players take the role of **Exiles**, warriors and adventurers cast into unstable realms known as the **EverRealms**. Each run is a high-stakes expedition where players:

- Enter a hostile realm
- Explore, fight, and loot
- Decide when to extract
- Risk losing all carried gear if they die

Survival and smart decision-making are just as important as combat skill.

## 🧭 Core Pillars

- **Extraction Gameplay**  
  Every run is about risk vs reward. You only keep what you successfully extract.

- **Medieval Fantasy Combat**  
  Melee-focused combat with swords, shields, magic, and ranged weapons.

- **Procedural Realms**  
  Each realm is dynamically generated with different layouts, enemies, and loot.

- **Persistent Progression**  
  Characters, gear, and upgrades persist between runs.
