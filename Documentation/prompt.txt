Hey ChatGPT, I am designing an extraction based game in Unity.

Here is a more in-depth explanation of my game:
EverRealm Exiles is a medieval extraction voxel game that will thrust the player into different types of randomly generated maps in order to loot, kill, and extract.


What happens before a run?
- manage inventory
- setup kit
What happens in the first 10 minutes of a run?
- get spawned in a random part of the map
- search around and loot
- PvPvE
- stay alive and find extract
What happens after run?
- manage inventory
